Agile a thing of the past - at least of the 90s. Sprints are mini-waterfall !

We doing it wrong, reversing the value proposition.

The civil engineering metaphor we're using is wrong.

"Sustainably minimise lead time to business impact (or results)" --> value stream, 90% of an item or US is waiting for things to happen

Surgery metaphor : nobody wants surgery unless it is mandatory, we want in that case professionals, proven techniques, not always the "standard methodology" ("we know Java, we do Java here")

Kaizen : also about anticipating skill needs, and getting people trained (w/ cross training)
