Difference in culture between Web scale companies (Goog, Netflix, Facebook) and Enterprise
 * Freedom and responsability, high trust
 * VS bureaucracy and blame, low trust

Developers responsabilities: faster, cheaper, safer.

Datacenter snowflakes (deploy: months / live: years) -> VM / Clouds (minutes / weeks) -> Containers (seconds / minutes) -> Lambda, serverless (millis / seconds)

Pushing the notion of evolvability to architecture. Architecture as to be as easy to change
as well (as code ?) -> Embracing the Agile manifesto principle of adapting to change.

First, design patterns helped in refactoring using well known patterns -> emergent design.

Then Enterprise Architecture and Integration patterns enabled to do the same at
the architecture level.

Then we practiced DB refactoring.

Next step : services, first attempt at breaking down the silos.

Then Continuous Delivery, delivers functionality reliably when needed.

Agile a thing of the past - at least of the 90s. Sprints are mini-waterfall !

We doing it wrong, reversing the value proposition.

The civil engineering metaphor we're using is wrong.

"Sustainably minimise lead time to business impact (or results)" --> value stream, 90% of an item or US is waiting for things to happen

Surgery metaphor : nobody wants surgery unless it is mandatory, we want in that case professionals, proven techniques, not always the "standard methodology" ("we know Java, we do Java here")

Kaizen : also about anticipating skill needs, and getting people trained (w/ cross training)
