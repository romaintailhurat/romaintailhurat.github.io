<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Concurrency ~ Parallelism</p>
<p>Rob Pike definition :</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.</li>
<li>Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parallelism is everywhere : at the bit level, in the CPU, at the task level.</p>
<p>Concurrency allows your software to be responsive, fault tolerant, efficient, and simple.</p>
<p>Distributed systems are intrinsically concurrent.</p>
<p>But we still want simple softwares, easy to think about !</p>
<h2 id="threads-and-locks">Threads and locks</h2>
<p>The simplest model : when executing multiple threads sharing memory we know bad things are going to happen (non deterministic behavior), so why not lock memory when one thread need to write it ? Yes but no, locks are hard to deal with and might lead to deadlocks... and there is only one way to stop a thread deadlocked : stop the runtime execution !</p>
<p>We could then use interruption mechanism such as timeouts when trying to acquire a lock. But still we only stop a deadlock in a controlled fashion, but we could return to the same deadlock situation... And choosing the right timeout duration could be hard.</p>
<p>Techniques for handling concurrency exist :</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent editing a data structure could be done with Hand-over-Hand Locking.</li>
<li>We can check conditions of lock between threads, i.e. a thread could signal another that the condition for a lock might have a new state.</li>
<li>Atomic variable or data structure allow for lock-free concurrent algorithms.</li>
</ul>
