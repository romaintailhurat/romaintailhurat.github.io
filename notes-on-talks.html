<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-of-evolutionary-architecture-2016">VIDEO</a></p>
<p>Pushing the notion of evolvability to architecture. Architecture as to be as easy to change as well (as code ?) -&gt; Embracing the Agile manifesto principle of adapting to change.</p>
<p>First, design patterns helped in refactoring using well known patterns -&gt; emergent design.</p>
<p>Then Enterprise Architecture and Integration patterns enabled to do the same at the architecture level.</p>
<p>Then we practiced DB refactoring.</p>
<p>Next step : services, first attempt at breaking down the silos.</p>
<p>Then Continuous Delivery, delivers functionality reliably when needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://craft-conf.com/2015">VIDEO</a> Agile a thing of the past - at least of the 90s. Sprints are mini-waterfall !</p>
<p>We doing it wrong, reversing the value proposition.</p>
<p>The civil engineering metaphor we're using is wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Sustainably minimise lead time to business impact (or results)&quot; --&gt; value stream, 90% of an item or US is waiting for things to happen</p>
<p>Surgery metaphor : nobody wants surgery unless it is mandatory, we want in that case professionals, proven techniques, not always the &quot;standard methodology&quot; (&quot;we know Java, we do Java here&quot;)</p>
<p>Kaizen : also about anticipating skill needs, and getting people trained (w/ cross training)</p>
